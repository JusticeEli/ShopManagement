# ShopManagement

-This  app is built on top of the solana blockchain network,it helps in managing records of all goods being sold in a shop.


Currently all the records is stored in the solana blockchain,am using a [Rest Api](https://github.com/JusticeEli/shop-manager-api#readme) to handle all the business logic.The code for the smart contract can be found here [Solana Program](https://github.com/JusticeEli/shop-manager#readme)





User can flag a product as being out of stock, itâ€™s also
convenient for recalculating the total amount of goods a customer has bought.
